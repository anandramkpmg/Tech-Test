System should allow you to create accounts, list and filter them. 
I tried to cover all technical aspects that was mentioned in the tech test. 

Technology used : .Net core 3.1, Angular latest , RxJs, Mapper, N Unit, EF Core - code first approach, SQL.

I would like to do below mentioned tasks, but leaving it due to time constraints.

Wanted to logically split the server side project in to smaller ones.
Listing accounts can be sepearted in to a different component - but demonstrated this in reusable accounts filter component.
I can make ui much prettier than this,but didnt bother too much as this was mentioned in the test as well.
